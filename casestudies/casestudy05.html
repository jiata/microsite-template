	<p><em>"ANSYS and Microsoft Azure have been working closely on a Proof of Concept with a large customer to run ANSYS CFD workload on Azure,”</em> said Ray Milhem, Vice President of enterprise solutions at ANSYS. <em>“The POC proved very successful and the data showed excellent scalability running ANSYS CFD up to 1024 cores.”</em></p>
	<br>
	<p>
	Over the past several months we have worked closely with the CFD Solver team at ANSYS to make sure ANSYS CFD code runs successfully on the Azure Linux RDMA stack and scales up to thousands of cores. Azure delivers a high level of scalability and performance with ANSYS CFD because of its dedicated high-speed low-latency network fabric that uses remote direct memory access (RDMA) and Infiniband technology. RDMA computing provides very low latency close to three microseconds and 32 Gbps bandwidth. This results in great scaling performance running your large compute CFD jobs in the Azure cloud.  
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>We ran multiple simulation models from ANSYS CFD version 16.2 on CentOS 6.5 with Intel MPI on Azure A9 instances (Intel E5-2670 at 2.6 GHz, Memory 112GB, 1600MHz DDR3, QDR InfiniBand). The three models that we ran were Combustor (71 million cells), F1 Race Car (140 million cells) and Open Race Car (280 million cells) respectively. You can clearly see the scaling numbers in the diagram above for the the F1 Race Car model.
