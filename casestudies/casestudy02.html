    <p>Many industries rely on predictive simulation analysis to develop their products – simulating car crashes is one example. However, these simulations generate enormous amounts of data which can be hard to manage, analyze and store.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>d3VIEW</strong> is an application that tackles this problem. It manages simulation projects which integrates with <strong>LS-DYNA</strong>, a simulation software package for non-linear analysis. Recently, <strong>d3VIEW</strong> began running their applicattion on <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>, leveraging on <strong>Azure’s</strong> elasticity, scalability and rich open-source support. “.. We are excited to see our application working with minimal changed in Azure,” says <strong>Suri Bala, Founder and CEO of d3VIEW</strong>. “We thought we would need to port our product to another operating system first, but <strong>Azure</strong> has full support for <strong>Linux</strong> and open-source languages.”</p>
