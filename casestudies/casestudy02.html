    <p>Many industries rely on predictive simulation analysis to develop their products – simulating car crashes is one example. However, these simulations generate enormous amounts of data which can be hard to manage, analyze and store.</p>
    <br>
    <p>d3VIEW is an application that tackles this problem. It manages simulation projects which integrates with LS-DYNA, a simulation software package for non-linear analysis. Recently, d3VIEW began running their applicattion on Microsoft Azure, leveraging on Azure’s elasticity, scalability and rich open-source support. “.. We are excited to see our application working with minimal changed in Azure,” says Suri Bala, Founder and CEO of d3VIEW. “We thought we would need to port our product to another operating system first, but Azure has full support for Linux and open-source languages.”</p>
