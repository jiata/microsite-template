    <p>As trade volumes have increased and global financial markets have become even more interconnected, managing risk has become a top priority for banks and securities traders. This means they must perform more complex computations that require a larger volume of compute resources.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For many investment banks, asset managers, and trading firms, achieving new standards for compliance means investing millions of dollars in additional compute power and datacenter space. MUFJ, a member of MUFG, a global financial group, decided to go about it a little differently. “We have to be proactive,” says Robert K. Griffiths, the company's Head of High Performance Computing. "[We need to be] more nimble in terms of how we deliver risk and add value to the company.”</p>
	<br>
	<p>To compute its risk calculations, MUFG quantitative analysts needed to process more than 100 gigabytes of data in less than 12 hours every night, but as the firm grew, it was becoming prohibitively expensive to buy more licenses, more computers for its on-premises grid. So, MUFG decided to move its on-premises, high-performance computing (HPC) grids to Azure. <strong>Instead of buying hundreds of servers on its on-premises grid, they now uses the deployment, administration, job scheduling, and monitoring tools in Microsoft HPC Pack to offload its daily risk calculations to Azure.</strong> With a dramatic increase in computing power, and no increase in staffing, the company saves millions of dollars in servers and datacenter space. On Azure, MUFJ now has the ability to scale almost instantaneously following a market event.</p>
